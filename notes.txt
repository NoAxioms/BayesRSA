Enumeration:
	When we enumerate a variable, we do not need to mention it in guide? Why?
	Enumeration does not allow you to predict values of discrete variables, unless you use infer_discrete
	first_available_dim = -1 - max_plate_nesting
	infer_discrete does MAP when passed temperature=0
	infer_discrete produces correct samples, but incorrect logprobs.
		Can I still use it to learn item-attribute relations?

	Restriction 2: no downstream coupling. 


Base Speaker Form
	If we assume base speaker comes from attributes, we can more easily do attribute grouping (ex. noticing that red and blue are colors and contradictory)
	If we assume base speaker is sampled from dirichlet, we can account for more subtle effects. 
	Sample complexity is Very important here. Attribute-based seems more efficient b.c. it is binary v continuous.
