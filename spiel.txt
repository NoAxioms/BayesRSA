We intend to leverage the goal-oriented nature of communication to learn language groundings more quickly.
More specifically, we define a generative model for a human's speech. This model has as latent variables the attributes/vocabulary of each item, along with the human's goal. We assume the human tries to distinguish their target item from the surrounding objects. This allows us to infer the properties of the surrounding objects based on a description of the target. For example, if the human asks for 'the blue hammer', there is likely only a single blue hammer in the scene.
