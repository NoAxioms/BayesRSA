store trajectories by trial. use parallel trial plate (sequential for now, parallelize later)
trajectories = []
trajectory.target_item = int if known, else string corresponding to param belief.
	The belief could just be 'item_probs_<trajectory id>'. This makes it harder to connect targets across trajectories, but we shouldn't need to anyway. This disallows throwing away trajectories, keep the id.
trajectory.utterances = list of words
trajectory.gestures

If this merging item and lexicon inference works poorly, split and use bayes rule for item belief using approx. lexicon and gesture probs.


make gesture sometimes return none. How?


Need function to add new word to vocab. Really, take in set of items, set of words, but this will do for now

Lexicon is not being updated during trial. Why?
