It can learn lexicon with single-word utterances. It infers that new words probably refer to previously unmentioned items. It can use gesture to infer target item.

Use gesture to inform language - currently, it doesn't understand that pointing to the left and saying "red" means something on the left is probably red.
	Unknown time. Hopefully < 1 day
	It seems that lexicon is not updated until the second trial. After that, it seems to be updated rationally but still ignoring gesture.
Make faster - takes a few seconds to do a proper belief update. Options: Use enumeration. Separate out lexicon model and desired object model. Use explicit belief update (bayes rule) for itendifying item in trial.
