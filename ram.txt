~~~~~~~~TODO~~~~~~~~
~~Short Term:~~
Incorporate multiple contexts. This is where the rsa nature should shine.
	How to format data? We can do (target, context, histogram) triples. We maintain s_0 for all objects, then restrict to the context by using a view.
	We can either initialize s_0 at the beginning, or once for each observation. The former.

~~Medium Term~~
Allow flexible vocabulary size. Transform datastructure when new words/objects are introduced.
Play around with initialization schemes - ex. use histogram to initialize dirichlet prior concentrations.
~~Longer Term~~
Network with existing language/vision tools so that this acts as a complement.




Tricks to be used:
Online Updates: Use posterior as prior https://forum.pyro.ai/t/online-updates-of-guide/352


Thoughts:
An ideal system uses all the tricks.
We could blend together low, mid, and high sample complexity methods. At very low sample data, use direct histogram type methods (initialize s_0 as histogram). At mid, use this model. At high, use NN. The current rsa pyro method may take upwards of 7 seconds to converge, but scales well with data. Use existing networks when applicable for final version.
Should act based on most probable s_0 based on dirichlet concentration.

DO I want to add the option to restric tthe support of the word distributions? This could speed up learning with large item/word sets if used intelligently. Ignore for now.
